		<br><br>
		<p>
			Sri Lanka is home to several species of turtles, including the Olive Ridley, Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Leatherback Turtle.
			However, due to a number of factors including habitat loss, poaching, and pollution, all of these turtle species are in danger of going extinct.
		</p>
		<p>
			Several marine turtle conservation projects have been established by Sri Lanka's Department of Wildlife Conservation in significant nesting locales across the nation.
			
			Despite these efforts, Sri Lanka's turtle populations are still in danger, necessitating additional work to ensure their survival.

		<br>
		<p>
			Sea turtles have a rich history that spans millions of years. These ancient creatures have inhabited the Earth's oceans for over 100 million years, evolving into remarkable marine reptiles. 
			Sea turtles have navigated the seas during various geological periods, adapting to changing environments and enduring significant challenges. 
			</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, human activities, such as habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and poaching, have posed significant threats to sea turtles' survival. 
		Conservation efforts and awareness campaigns have been crucial in safeguarding these magnificent creatures, aiming to protect their nesting grounds, reduce threats,
		and promote responsible fishing practices. We strive to secure a brighter future for sea turtles, ensuring their continued presence 
		and contribution to the biodiversity and ecological health of our oceans.</p>

                Sea turtles rely on their rear flippers to excavate a cavity in the sandy beach, carefully crafting a nest in which they can safely deposit their eggs.
				This intricate process involves using their powerful flippers to dig into the sand, creating a suitable environment for the development of their offspring. </p>

    <h2>Sea Turtle Categories</h2>
    
    <p>In Sri Lanka, the coastal waters are home to a diverse range of sea turtle species, including the Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, and Olive Ridley Turtle. 
    These majestic creatures are an integral part of the coastal ecosystem, contributing to its balance and biodiversity. 
   </p>
  <p>
  Sri Lanka has recognized the importance of conserving these sea turtles and has 
  implemented various initiatives and protective measures to ensure their survival. Conservation efforts, such as nesting beach monitoring, hatchery management, and public awareness campaigns, 
  are in place to safeguard these endangered species and promote their sustainable coexistence with human activities along the coastline.</p>

	<h1>Life Cycle Of A Sea Turtle</h1>
	
	<p>Sea turtles undergo a remarkable life cycle involving distinct stages. During nesting season, female turtles come ashore to dig nests and lay eggs, after which they return to feeding areas to replenish their energy.
	Hatchlings emerge from the eggs, make their way to the ocean under the cover of darkness, and embark on a swimming frenzy to reach deeper waters. They then enter an open-ocean stage, 
	living in flotsam and feeding on various resources for several years to decades.</p>
	
	<p>After the oceanic phase, juvenile turtles move to nearshore feeding areas to continue their growth. Adult turtles also occupy these areas until they gather enough energy reserves to migrate to breeding areas 
	for reproduction. Males and females migrate to coastal areas near nesting beaches to mate. Females lay multiple clutches of eggs, often returning to the same beach they hatched from (natal homing). 
	Mating can involve multiple partners, as males actively seek out as many females as possible. Once mating is complete, males return to feeding areas, while females stay near the nesting beach during the nesting season.</p>
